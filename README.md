# Radon
Radon is an experimental mod designed to apply targeted optimizations for minecraft commands- especially in enviorments with many datapacks. It currently:
* Limits serialization of NBT data to the requested data instead of all the data, saving massive time on serialization (especially for players)
* (WIP) Caches selected tags allowing for faster @e lookups

## Setup

Put into your fabric mods folder or just download with the [smithed client](https://smithed.dev/).
